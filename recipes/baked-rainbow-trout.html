        <h3>Steps</h3>

            </li>
            <li>Place trout in the prepared baking dish and coat with 
                remaining olive oil. Season inside and outside of fish 
                with dill, thyme and salt. Stuff each fish with onion 
                slices; grind pepper on top. Place 1 lemon slice on each 
                fish.
